# miTurno

**miTurno** is an online appointment manager

As ***user*** you will be able to set appointments by choosing a branch, date and time. You will see the available hours of each branch and with a color code which are the available hours (green), not available (red) and those that have few appointments available (yellow). You will be able to modify appointments, cancel them and see their history and status.

As ***admin*** you can create, modify and delete branches, manage users and assign operator roles, assign or reassign operators to each branch. In addition, you will be able to act as an operator in any branch.

As ***operator*** you will be able to view all the appointments of the branch in which you were assigned by the administrator, check who has appointments and confirm attendance.

All users can view and modify their profile information.
